Your task is to analyze OCR text content and extract specific fields into a structured JSON format.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. The input text comes from Azure Document Intelligence OCR, so there may be some OCR errors or inaccuracies
2. Return ONLY valid JSON - no additional text, explanations, or formatting
3. Use the EXACT field names as shown in the expected JSON structure below
4. If a field is not found or cannot be extracted, use an empty string ""

VALIDATION RULES:
5. Phone number formatting:
   - mobilePhone - טלפון נייד: If 10 digits and doesn't start with "0", replace first digit with "0". must starts with "0" and probably starts with "05"
   - Landline phone - טלפון קווי: If 9 digits and doesn't start with "0", replace first digit with "0". must starts with "0". make sure you are really reduce the first digit if it is needed.
6. ID number: If longer than 9 digits, keep only the first 9 digits. Must be exactly 9 digits or empty string
7. Dates should be in DD, MM, YYYY format with leading zeros
8. Text formatting: For any English text in the final JSON, ensure sentences start with a capital letter

LOGICAL VALIDATION:
9. Be careful with this, but try to avoid mixing up data and ensure that extracted values make logical sense for their field type:
   - Address fields (accidentAddress - כתובת מקום התאונה, street - רחוב): Should contain actual addresses
   - Name fields (firstName, lastName): Should contain actual names, not addresses or descriptions
   - Phone fields: Should contain only numbers in correct phone format
   - Date fields: Should contain actual dates, not text descriptions
   - Gender field: Should be "Male"/"Female" or "זכר"/"נקבה", or empty string
   - Amount fields: Should be numeric, can be empty string if not applicable
   - ID numbers: Should be numeric, exactly 9 digits
   - Job types: Should describe actual occupations/work
   - Body parts: Should be actual body part names (arm, leg, back, etc.)
   - Time fields: Should be in HH:MM format

INPUT STRUCTURE:
The input has two sections:
- "Key-Value Pairs": Fields automatically detected by Azure OCR
- "Raw Lines": All extracted text lines (backup in case key-value pairs missed something)

EXPECTED JSON OUTPUT STRUCTURE:
{schema}

Extract the information carefully and return only the JSON object."""
